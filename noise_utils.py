    """Generate random walk noise to apply to a position sequence.

    This function generates noise that follows a random walk pattern in velocity
    space, which is then integrated to get position noise. The noise standard
    deviation at the last step is controlled by noise_std_last_step.

    Args:
        position_sequence: Tensor of particle positions over time
            Shape: [num_particles, num_timesteps, num_dimensions]
        noise_std_last_step: Target standard deviation of noise at the last step

    Returns:
        Tensor of position noise with same shape as position_sequence
            Shape: [num_particles, num_timesteps, num_dimensions]

    Note:
        The noise is generated as a random walk in velocity space and then
        integrated to get position noise. The noise at each step is scaled
        so that the final step has the desired standard deviation.
